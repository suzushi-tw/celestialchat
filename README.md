## CelestialChat proxy verison

CelestialChat is a simple AI chat to deliver fast saerch results powered by Claude Haiku and Tavily search. 

** this is a proxy verison, by using NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL it will rewrite the request 

## Todo

Scroll behavior, although with the speed of Claude, following the text might not offer optimal experience.

Include Image in the search results, I haven't find an Image search api that delivers results matching the answers.
